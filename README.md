# Enhanced TCM Target Prioritization System

This project implements an enhanced target prioritization system for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds, incorporating drug structural similarity and protein sequence similarity for more accurate predictions.

## Features

- Graph-based embedding of drug-target interactions
- Integration of disease importance for targets
- Drug structural similarity using molecular fingerprints
- Protein sequence similarity using sequence alignment
- Weighted prioritization system with optimizable parameters
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization
